Students, as well as literacy enthusiast tend to read many books simutaneously, but it can be hard to keep track of your books, the last page read, etc... Instead of using the old school/old fashioned book markers, BookGuru introduces a simple feature where user can keep track of the book name, the author name, the last page read, last line read, and wheater the book is physical or a pdf. So when you pick up that book you haven't read in three months, you will know excatly where you stopped.
